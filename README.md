OnTime is a web development project created as part of my university coursework. This project is hosted on GitHub and is built using pure HTML and CSS, with no additional libraries or frameworks.

The main objective of OnTime is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing project timelines and deadlines. The website is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with a simple layout and intuitive controls.

One of the key benefits of OnTime is its simplicity and ease of use. The website is lightweight and fast, with a minimalistic design that focuses on functionality over aesthetics. Additionally, because it is built using only HTML and CSS, it can be easily customized and extended to meet the needs of individual users or teams.

Overall, OnTime is a practical and efficient solution for managing project timelines and deadlines, and serves as a great example of the capabilities of pure HTML and CSS web development.
